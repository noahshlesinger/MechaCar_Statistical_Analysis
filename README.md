## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The Vehicle Weight, Spoiler Angle, and AWD variables had a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. The slope of the linear model is considered to be non-zero. This model predicts 0.7149 when looking at the multiple r-squared values and the P-Value is to the -12th power. This demonstrates accuracy and effectiveness for the model's ability to predict MPG.
