# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The Vehicle Weight, Spoiler Angle, and AWD variables had a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. The slope of the linear model is considered to be non-zero. This model predicts 0.7149 when looking at the multiple r-squared values and the P-Value is to the -12th power. This demonstrates accuracy and effectiveness for the model's ability to predict MPG.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
